## Research Abstract

Due to the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), many areas including healthcare, smart homes, and industrial automation have been
greatly advanced, however, it has also made these systems prone to several security and privacy concerns. A recent study revealed that 98% of IoT device
traffic is not encrypted which makes the devices prone to threats like man-inthe-middle and information disclosure (Cyrus, 2021). Furthermore, 57% of
IoT devices are affected to medium or high severity threats which shows how
crucial it is to enhance the threat modeling process (Unit 42 IoT Threat Report, 2020). Although the potential for danger is high, conventional security
model, for instance, STRIDE and privacy model, for instance, LINDDUN
cannot fully capture the risks specific to IoT environment.

This paper aims at assessing the ability of STRIDE and LINDDUN in identifying the IoT-specific threats through conducting the detailed threat modeling and comparing the results with the real-life examples of IoT vulnerabilities. The findings of STRIDE will be elaborated on in relation to security
aspects for instance spoofing and denial of service while LINDDUNâ€™s findings will be discussed in relation to privacy concerns such as linkability and
data disclosure. The outcome of this study is to identify the shortcomings of
both frameworks especially in relation to risks that are of high interest including firmware level root compromise, physical tampering and cross device
compromise.

The results of this study identified gaps in both STRIDE and LINDDUN
when applied to IoT systems, revealing their strengths and limitations in
addressing IoT-specific threats. Based on the examination of these frameworks in various contexts of IoT, the study determines the effectiveness of the
frameworks in identifying the threats and the areas that need improvement.
